Stock Management System Overview
The Stock Management System is a terminal-based application designed to help users manage stock, suppliers, and user credentials effectively. This system is built for efficiency and simplicity, offering an intuitive command-line interface for users to interact with the system's core features.

With the growing need for businesses to maintain accurate and real-time records of stock and suppliers, this system provides the necessary tools to manage these aspects while ensuring secure handling of user credentials. The goal of the system is to minimize complexity and allow for quick, efficient stock management operations, all within a terminal-based environment.

Features of the Stock Management System
1. Add, Edit, and Delete Supplier Information
Purpose: The system provides the capability to manage supplier data, which is essential for maintaining good supplier relationships and ensuring that inventory is replenished when needed.
Add Supplier:
Users can add new suppliers by entering key information such as supplier name, contact details, payment terms, and delivery schedules.
This feature helps keep track of multiple suppliers, each offering different products or services.
Edit Supplier:
The system allows users to edit existing supplier records to update information like new contact details, delivery times, or product offerings.
Delete Supplier:
Suppliers who are no longer in business or are no longer used can be deleted from the system.
This ensures that the system only reflects active supplier data, maintaining the accuracy of inventory operations.
Use Case Example:

A user can add a new supplier for electronic components, such as "Tech Supply Co.," and later edit their contact details if the supplier changes their phone number or address. If the supplier discontinues service, the user can delete their information from the system.
2. Add, Edit, and Delete Item Details
Purpose: Effective management of items is critical for tracking stock levels and ensuring the business can meet customer demands without overstocking or understocking.
Add Item:
Users can add new items to the inventory by specifying details such as item name, category, price, quantity, and supplier association.
Items can be categorized based on types like electronics, clothing, or office supplies, making it easier to locate and manage them.
Edit Item:
If the price or quantity of an item changes (due to sales, discounts, or inventory updates), users can modify the item’s details.
Delete Item:
Obsolete or discontinued items can be removed from the system, ensuring that the inventory stays relevant and manageable.
Use Case Example:

A user may add a new item, "Laptop - Model X," with details like its price, stock quantity, and supplier. Later, if the price changes due to a promotional discount, the user can update the item’s price. If the model is discontinued, the user can delete it from the inventory.
3. Track Stock Levels and Inventory Status
Purpose: Efficiently managing stock levels is key to preventing shortages or overstocking, both of which can lead to lost sales or increased storage costs. The system helps users track and monitor stock levels in real-time.
Track Stock Levels:
Users can view current stock levels for each item and identify which products need to be restocked.
Inventory updates automatically as items are added or removed, keeping the data up-to-date.
Inventory Status:
The system provides a snapshot of inventory status, such as which items are running low, which are overstocked, and which are selling well.
Alerts can be set up for low stock items, ensuring timely restocking and preventing stockouts.
Stock Reporting:
Users can generate reports on stock levels, sales trends, and other metrics, helping to optimize purchasing decisions and stock management strategies.
Use Case Example:

A user can check the stock level of "Laptop - Model X" to see if they need to order more units from their supplier. If the system indicates that stock is running low, the user can take action to restock before a shortage occurs.
4. Change and Update User Credentials Securely
Purpose: Security is critical in any system that handles sensitive data. The ability to securely manage user credentials ensures that only authorized personnel can access and modify stock and supplier information.
Add User:
New users can be added to the system, providing them with specific roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, or User) to control their access levels.
Each user will have their own login credentials, ensuring accountability and traceability.
Edit User Credentials:
User roles and credentials can be updated. For example, a user may be promoted from "Manager" to "Admin," granting them higher levels of access to the system.
Password changes are also supported to ensure that user accounts remain secure.
Delete User:
If a user no longer requires access to the system, they can be removed from the system entirely. This ensures that only active, authorized users can make modifications to the system.
Password Security:
Passwords are stored securely (using hashing and encryption), preventing unauthorized access even if the system is compromised.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
The system supports role-based access, ensuring that different users have different levels of access based on their role. For example:
Admin: Full access to all features, including adding/editing users, managing suppliers, and managing stock.
Manager: Access to stock management and supplier data, but no access to modify user credentials.
User: Limited access, such as viewing stock levels and adding items but not modifying sensitive information.
Use Case Example:

An administrator can add a new user to the system with the role of "Manager," giving them permission to manage stock and supplier details but not access to change system settings or modify user credentials. If this manager leaves the company, their user account can be deleted, ensuring no unauthorized access to the system.
User Interface
While the system is designed to be terminal-based, it maintains a user-friendly experience through simple, intuitive commands and clear output. Some possible terminal commands may include:

add supplier: Adds a new supplier to the database.
edit item: Edits the details of an existing item.
view stock: Displays the current inventory status, including stock levels and low stock alerts.
update password: Allows users to update their credentials securely.
This approach allows businesses to efficiently handle their stock management needs directly from the terminal without the need for a complex graphical user interface, making it lightweight and easy to operate.

Conclusion
The Stock Management System repository offers a command-line-based application for effectively managing suppliers, inventory, and user access credentials. It simplifies core tasks like adding/editing suppliers, tracking stock levels, and securely managing user credentials. By using this system, businesses can streamline their inventory management processes, improve efficiency, and maintain secure user access. This system is particularly beneficial for users who prefer terminal environments and need a lightweight solution for stock management without the complexity of a GUI.
